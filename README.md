**Key findings:**
- **Activation mechanism**  
  CXCL17 binds to **MRGPRX2** on human mast cells, triggering **calcium mobilization** and **degranulation** in a concentration-dependent manner (effect diminished by MRGPRX2 knockdown).
- **Relevance for psoriasis**  
  Elevated CXCL17 in psoriatic skin localizes near MRGPRX2-positive, tryptase-positive mast cells. Spatial transcriptomics indicate increased mast cell activation or density in lesional compared to non-lesional skin.

This work identifies CXCL17 as an **endogenous agonist** of MRGPRX2 with potential implications in inflammatory skin conditions like psoriasis.


### Spatial Transcriptomics Analysis of psoriatic skin
- **Study design**: Paired lesional and non-lesional biopsies from 3 psoriasis patients.  
- **Analysis**: 
  - H&E images showing counts of CXCL17 and TPSB2 in lesional and non-lesional skin
  - UMAP embedding showing expression of mast cell marker TPSB2 
  - Boxplot and statistical testing between expression levels of TPSB2 in lesional vs. non-lesional skin
  - Spatial correlation between TPSB2 and CXCL17 within the epidermis 
- **Findings**:  
  - Mast cells were **significantly enriched in psoriatic lesions** vs. non-lesional skin (p = 6.42 × 10⁻⁶).  
  - **CXCL17 expression correlated positively with TPSB2**, linking CXCL17 to mast-cell presence/activation in psoriasis.
